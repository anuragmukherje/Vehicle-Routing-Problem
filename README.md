# Genetic Algorithms for Solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

## 📌 Introduction to Genetic Algorithms
### What are Genetic Algorithms (GAs)?
Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are optimization techniques inspired by **natural selection and evolution**. They simulate the process of natural selection by evolving potential solutions over generations to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems.

### Why Use Genetic Algorithms?
GAs are particularly useful for:
- **Solving complex optimization problems** where traditional algorithms struggle.
- **Handling large search spaces efficiently** without brute-force computation.
- **Finding near-optimal solutions** when exact solutions are computationally expensive.

### How GAs Work (Simplified Explanation)
1. **Initialization**: Generate an initial population of potential solutions.
2. **Selection**: Choose the best individuals based on a fitness function.
3. **Crossover (Recombination)**: Combine parts of two individuals to create offspring.
4. **Mutation**: Introduce small random changes to maintain diversity.
5. **Repeat**: Continue evolving until a stopping condition is met (e.g., reaching a certain number of generations or achieving a satisfactory solution).

## 🚚 The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)
### What is VRP?
The **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)** is a **combinatorial optimization problem** that focuses on finding the most efficient routes for a fleet of vehicles delivering goods to multiple locations.

### Challenges in VRP
- **Minimizing total travel distance** to save costs.
- **Balancing vehicle loads** while ensuring all customers are served.
- **Handling constraints** like delivery time windows and fuel limits.
- **Computational complexity** increases exponentially with the number of locations.

### Why is VRP Important?
VRP is widely used in:
- **Logistics and supply chain management** to optimize delivery routes.
- **Ride-sharing and public transportation** for efficient vehicle dispatching.
- **E-commerce and last-mile delivery** to minimize shipping costs.

## 🏗 Project Implementation and Code Explanation
### 📌 Genetic Algorithm Setup
1. **Population Representation**
   - Each individual (chromosome) represents a potential solution (a set of routes for vehicles).
   - Solutions are encoded as permutations of customer locations.

2. **Fitness Function**
   - Evaluates the quality of a solution based on total route distance.
   - Penalizes solutions that violate constraints (e.g., exceeding vehicle capacity).

3. **Selection Methods**
   - **Roulette Wheel Selection**: Probabilistic selection based on fitness scores.
   - **Tournament Selection**: Random selection of individuals, with the best one chosen.

4. **Crossover Techniques**
   - **Partially Mapped Crossover (PMX)**: Preserves order while exchanging segments between parents.
   - **Order Crossover (OX)**: Transfers a sequence from one parent while preserving relative order in the offspring.

5. **Mutation Operators**
   - **Swap Mutation**: Randomly swaps two locations in a route.
   - **Inversion Mutation**: Reverses a segment of the route to create a new variation.

6. **Stopping Criteria**
   - The algorithm runs for a fixed number of generations or until improvement stagnates.

### 📌 Sample Code Snippet (Initializing Population)
```python
import numpy as np

def initialize_population(num_individuals, num_locations):
    population = []
    for _ in range(num_individuals):
        individual = np.random.permutation(num_locations).tolist()
        population.append(individual)
    return population

# Example usage
num_individuals = 50
num_locations = 20
population = initialize_population(num_individuals, num_locations)
print("Sample Individual:", population[0])
```

## 📊 Experimentation and Results
### 📌 Experimental Configurations
We tested different configurations of selection, crossover, and mutation:
- **Selection Methods**: Tournament vs. Roulette Wheel.
- **Crossover Operators**: PMX vs. OX.
- **Mutation Rates**: 2%, 5%, and 10%.

### 📌 Results Summary
| Configuration | Best Fitness Score | Avg. Generations to Converge |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Tournament + PMX + 5% Mutation | **200.5 km** | 35 |
| Roulette Wheel + OX + 2% Mutation | 220.7 km | 50 |
| Tournament + OX + 10% Mutation | 210.2 km | 40 |

### 📌 Key Observations
- **Tournament Selection consistently performed better** than Roulette Wheel selection.
- **Lower mutation rates (2-5%) produced more stable results**, while higher mutation rates led to unnecessary variations.
- **PMX crossover resulted in better solutions** compared to OX, preserving route order effectively.
- **More generations led to improved solutions** but also increased computation time.

### 📌 Visualization of Results
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

generations = list(range(1, 51))
fitness_scores = [500 / (1 + 0.9 ** gen) for gen in generations]  # Simulated decreasing trend

plt.plot(generations, fitness_scores, marker='o', linestyle='-')
plt.xlabel('Generations')
plt.ylabel('Best Fitness Score')
plt.title('Fitness Score Over Generations')
plt.show()
```
